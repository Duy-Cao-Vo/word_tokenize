\subsection{Evaluation Measures}

We used Precision, Recall, F1 score as evaluation measures.

$$F_1 = \frac{2*P*R}{P + R}$$

where P (Precision), and R (Recall) are determined as follows:

$$P = \frac{{NE}_{true}}{NE_{sys}}$$

$$R = \frac{{NE}_{true}}{NE_{ref}}$$

where

$NE_{true}$: The number of NEs in gold data

$NE_{sys}$: The number of NEs in recognizing system

$NE_{true}$: The number of NEs which is correctly recognized by the system

\subsection{Results}

% TODO To be updated

\section{Conclusion}

We have introduced our approach and its experimental result in named entity recognition for Vietnamese text.
